# Simple PHP To-Do List

Hi! This is my small project where I made a simple To-Do List using PHP.  
I wanted to learn how sessions work and how to add/delete tasks without using a database.

## How to use

1. You need a PHP server like XAMPP.  
2. Put this project folder inside the server folder (htdocs for XAMPP).  
3. Open `http://localhost/list/list.php` in your browser.  
4. Add tasks in the box and delete them when done.

## What I learned

- How to use PHP sessions for saving data temporarily.  
- Handling form data with POST and GET requests.  
- Basic styling with CSS to make it look better.  
- How to use Git and GitHub for version control and sharing code.

Thanks for checking out my project! :)
